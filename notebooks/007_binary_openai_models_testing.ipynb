Remark: Assignment of this category may depend on viewpoint and political stance of rater, which can be mitigated by focusing on the definition above. If the content of a tweet describes a conspiratorial activity/process, it will be labeled “conspiracy theory”.\",\n",

Remark: This category includes all activities aimed at rallying the population for participation in a public election, description of election outcomes, and conduct of the election itself.\",\n",

Remark: This category will be used for statements/content which explicitly references other media outlets or journalists (e.g. “BBC has reported that …”, “Bellingcat has discovered a secret operation of X”).
